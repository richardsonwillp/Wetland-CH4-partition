This document serves as a reference for the contents of all output files produced by the partitioning program. The contents are split primarily into two sections 1) files produced by the originally published partitioning program (Iwata et al. 2018, Boundary-Layer Meteorology) and 2) files unique to this modified partitioning program (Richardson et al. 2022, Boundary-Layer Meteorology). Note that there is some occasional redundancy between the two sets of files, but this is maintained for the time being to ensure traceability of each subroutine of the partitioning program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Original program files

Note that all files are stored within subdirectories '/site_yr/run_ID' inside of the parent directories below

By directory:

- 'fig': 4x4 scatterplots (2 per period) of Wm vs. Wq, Wm vs. Wc, Wm vs. WT, WT vs. Wq

- 'txt': Files containing each 30-min. period’s wavelet coefficients (cols: index, u, w, T, q, CO2, CH4) that were kept after being filtered for frequency (i.e., fnLB <= fn <= fnUB; coefficients used to fit iteratively-reweighted linear regression). Note the ‘index’ column tracks the scale parameter (i.e., scale of the wavelet transform, or frequency) of each wavelet coefficient; its value ranges from 2^0 to 2^(M-1) with M being the number of scales used in the wavelet transform (M = log2(N) rounded down to the nearest integer, where N is the total number of data points in the time series)

- 'filt': All wavelet coefficients from each half-hour period with Boolean flags for whether the coefficient fell outside of the ebullition threshold based on q, c, or T. Also a column for whether or not the coefficient had a frequency value less than the lower bound (i.e., coefficient not considered in partitioning if value is 1)

- 'slope': Each half-hour period’s iteratively-reweighted linear regression slope coefficient for each of the regressions done in robust.R (NOTE: this information along with regression R2, RMSD, and MAD values are contained in the files labeled with 'RLMfitRMSDs_fnLB_?_fnUB_?' within the directory ref_data/Output/site_yr; see section 2) for more information)

- 'flux': Each half-hour period’s total and ebullitive flux estimate based on each reference scalar as well as the low frequency component of the flux (flux*.txt); the random error estimate for the diffusive and ebullitive components of the total flux (rerror*.txt) 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Modified program files 

*** Note, a text file of half-hourly sigma_m and sigma_m/u* is saved in ref_data/Input/site_yr when a site year of data is partitioned for the first time 

ref_data/Output top level:
--------------------------
- *_PartRunInfo.txt: the settings for each partitioning run; contains all user-supplied variables in sh/part_master.sh as well as the start and end times of the partitioning run

-  *_Interm_RefDf_allHH.csv: an intermediate dataframe created by the program containing all supplied half-hourly input values (can ignore for all intensive purposes)

- *_Interm_RefDf_?Part_filtHH_NLfilt.csv: an intermediate dataframe containing all supplied half-hourly input values but filtered for quality requirements pertaining to validity of eddy covariance assumptions, fetch requirements, and non-local processes for each reference scalar (replacing ? with either q or c) [this keeps a record of all baseline-filtered periods, in case the user wishes to customize downstream filtering processes after running the program; additionally, this record of the files contains the dimensionless flux-variance quantity [?_MOST_scale] for water vapor and carbon dioxide if the user wants to do further investigation into non-local processes]

- *_Interm_RefDf_?Part_filtHH.csv: an intermediate dataframe containing all supplied half-hourly input values but filtered for quality requirements pertaining to validity of eddy covariance assumptions and fetch requirements but NOT non-local processes (NOTE: it is highly recommended to filter for non-local processes, as these can also cause violations of local scalar similarity)

- *_RLMfitRMSDs_fnLB_?_fnUB_?.csv: results of iteratively-reweighted linear regression models fit between Wm–Wq, Wm–Wc, Wm–WT, and Wc–Wq for each half-hour period. The number of coefficients used to fit the model, along with model slope coefficient, R2, RMSD, and MAD values. Each time a new set of frequency bounds is used, the models must be re-fitted, and an additional version of the file is made (replacing both ? in the filename with the respective frequency bound values). Note, these data are also contained in the Full Output files (see below)

- *_RMSDx-sigmaCH4_slopes_EbThreshWidth_fnLB_?_fnUB_?.csv: contains possible values for the empirical RMSD parameter defining the ebullition threshold based on each reference scalar. Rows are indexed by the method of fitting the threshold (e.g., 'NonEb_LinReg' – linear regression between RMSD and the scaling quantity in non-ebullitive periods; 'QuantReg_q25' – quantile regression between RMSD and the scaling quantity in all best quality periods). Each column contains the values for a given reference scalar (i.e., q, c, or T) and scaling quantity (i.e., sigma_m or sigma_m/u*)

- *_MOST_FV_plot.png: a figure plotting the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory flux-variance relationship for each reference scalar in unstable conditions (should give a general idea of how often non-local processes are significant)

- *_ustar_distribution.png: histograms of the friction velocity in periods meeting the baseline quality requirements (i.e., the periods in the *_Interm_RefDf_?Part_filtHH_NLfilt.csv files)


ref_data/Output/run_ID:
-----------------------
- *_FracEb_RefScalFlux_brkpts.csv: results from the broken-line regressions fit between fractional ebullition and reference scalar fluxes. The estimated reference scalar thresholds are held in the columns labeled '_brkpt'. This component of the program is still in progress and it is currently recommended to identify these thresholds manually by examining the figure '*_RefScalarThreshPlot.png'. If the initial guess for the breakpoint value is bad, the algorithm will not converge and this file will not be produced

- *_Interm_RefDf_allHH_PostProcStats.csv: an intermediately saved dataframe created after running spectral and other post-processing stats (kept for traceability, can largely ignore)

- *_FullOutput_allHH.csv: a file containing all half-hourly outputs from the program for all periods. 	NOTE: all files labeled 'FullOutput' are indexed with time stamps in LOCAL time zone; all other outputs with timestamp-indexed data are in the logging time zone

- *_FullOutput_?Part_filtHH_NLfilt.csv: file containing all half-hourly outputs from the program for periods which met ALL quality requirements for the reference scalar represented by ?. These periods have been filtered for low magnitudes of the reference scalar flux and total CH4 flux as well as to remove periods with negative fractional ebullition.
***** these two files are likely what the user desires for further analysis without having to do much additional filtering. See the end of this document for a comprehensive key of column names in this file

- *_RMSDx-sigmaCH4_plot_fnLB_?_fnUB_?.png: two scatterplots (same data, one is zoomed in) of RMSDx vs. sigma_m with the resultant ebullition threshold values plotted as lines

- *_RMSDx-sigmaCH4_ust_plot_fnLB_?_fnUB_?.png: two scatterplots (same data, one is zoomed in) of RMSDx vs. sigma_m/u* with the resultant ebullition threshold values plotted as lines

NOTE: Because some processing steps for the modified partitioning program utilize the full growing season of observations, some output figures generated by running the sample data are not indicative of the processing steps that would have been used for the full data set. For reference, copies of these figures utilizing the sample site-year's complete dataset have been included in 'sample/ref_data/Output/full_season_plots'
